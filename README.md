## Responsive Web Design
### Personal Portfolio Webpage

This was the fifth of five projects to achieve the *Responsive Web Design* Certificate 

[This page](https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/) was what I had to recreate, and [this](https://stefankarlsson1230.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Personal-Portfolio-Webpage/) was my result.
